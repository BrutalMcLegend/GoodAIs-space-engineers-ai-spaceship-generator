Curious how the application creates new spaceships? Our spaceships are defined as L-system strings, with predefined expansion rules. We then use MAP-Elites, a Quality-Diversity algorithm, to control the exploration of FI-2Pop, a constrainted genetic algorithm. 

### L-system

### FI-2Pop

$f_{cs} =  \Sigma_{i=1}^{4} p(m_i(cs)) - 1_{asymmetry}$
