This application generates spaceships for Space Engineers using an evolutionary algorithm. New spaceships can continually be "evolved" from an initial population of spaceships.

You can select a spaceship from the population on the left (only those marked with the "â–£" symbol can be selected) and click the "**Evolve from selected spaceship**" button to generate new spaceships.

When you select a spaceship, its main properties are displayed on the right, and an interactive preview of the spaceship is displayed in the middle of the application window.

You can see the current progress on the bars on the left, and check system messages in the "**Log**" window on the right.
