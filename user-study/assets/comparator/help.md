How to use the program:

### Load data
Load the `.json` files you obtained from the previous step of the experiment here to preview the different spaceships.

### Rank the spaceships
Use the sliders to rank the different spaceships. Note that `1` is the lowest score, and `3` is the highest. Rank them with three different scores!

### Saving scores
Once you're happy with the scores, click the "Save" button to download the results! You will need to upload this file in the final part of the questionnaire.

## How do the spaceships look in-game?
