# User study

Notebooks used for final user study.

The executable of the webapp can be built by running the `build_main_webapp.bat` file.

The notebook `userstudy-simulation-ipynb` contains simulated data for the user study.

The folder `dummy_results` contains four different spaceship files and fictitious metrics that can be used to quickly test the ranker webapp.
