How to use the program:

###### "My spaceship"
Here you will see the content plot of your own spaceship, as well as the list of properties.

###### The reference spaceships
Here you will see other spaceships generated by the system that you may have not come across during your exploration session. The number above indicates how many are currently available.

###### Navigation and rating
It's possible to cycle through the reference spaceships by selecting the "<" and ">" buttons. By moving the values on the slider, it is possible to rate the reference spaceship currently displayed with respect to your own: if you like it more than yours, give it a positive rating, if you don't like it as much, give it a negative rating.

##### Saving ratings
Once all reference spaceships have been rated, it is possible to save the results by clicking the "SAVE" button and downloading the `.log` file.
