This application generates spaceships for Space Engineers using an evolutionary algorithm. New spaceships can continually be "evolved" from an initial population of spaceships.

You can select a spaceship from the population on the left (only those marked with the "â–£" symbol can be selected) and click the "**Evolve from selected spaceship**" button to generate new spaceships. Alternatively, you can click the "**Evolve from random spaceship**" button to generate new spaceships from a random selection.

When you select a spaceship, its main properties are displayed on the right, and an interactive preview of the spaceship is displayed in the middle of the application window. You can also download a spaceship by clicking the corresponding button below the spaceship properties.

You can see the current iteration number on the left, and check system messages in the "**Log**" window on the right.
