This application generates spaceships for Space Engineers using an evolutionary algorithm. New spaceships can continually be "evolved" from an initial population of spaceships.

You can select a spaceship from the population on the left (only those marked with the "â–£" symbol can be selected) and click the "**Evolve from selected spaceship**" button to generate new spaceships. Alternatively, you can click the "**Evolve from random spaceship**" button to generate new spaceships from a random selection.

When you select a spaceship, its main properties are displayed on the right, and an interactive preview of the spaceship is displayed in the middle of the application window. You can also download a spaceship by clicking the corresponding button below the spaceship properties. You can also change the base color of the spaceship by picking it from the widget next to the spaceship properties.

You can see the current iteration number on the left, and check system messages in the "**Log**" window on the right.

You can reinitialize the population by clicking the corresponding button (beware: it may take a while for the reinitialization to complete).
