This application generates spaceships for Space Engineers using an evolutionary algorithm. New spaceships can continually be "evolved" from an initial population of spaceships.

You can select a spaceship from the population on the left; all colored cells can be selected. The spaceship you selected will change its symbol to "☑". You can click the "**Evolve from selected spaceship**" button to generate new spaceships. After new spaceships are generated, the symbol "▣" will mark the cells in the grid with a new spaceship.

When you select a spaceship, its main properties are displayed on the right, and an interactive preview of the spaceship is displayed in the middle of the application window. You can also download a spaceship by clicking the corresponding button next to the spaceship properties. You can also change the base color of the spaceship by picking it from the widget next to the spaceship properties.

You can check system messages in the "**Log**" window on the right.
