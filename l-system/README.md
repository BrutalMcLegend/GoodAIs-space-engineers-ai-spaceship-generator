# L-System

A notebook illustrating a simple L-System applied to Space Engineers using the [Space Engineers API](https://github.com/iv4xr-project/iv4xr-se-plugin) and the PCGSEPy library.

Run the `l-system-demo.ipynb` notebook to view the demo.

Modify the `configs.ini` file to change settings. The files `hlrules` and `llrules` contain the rules definitions, whereas `hl_atoms.json` defines the high-level structures dimensions.

Running the `fi2pop-demo.ipynb` will reproduce the results presented in the paper
