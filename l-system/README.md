# L-System

A notebook illustrating a simple L-System applied to Space Engineers using the [Space Engineers API](https://github.com/iv4xr-project/iv4xr-se-plugin) using the PCGSEPy library.

Run the `l-system-demo.ipynb` notebook to view the demo.

Modify the `configs.ini` file to change settings.

`hlrules` and `llrules` files contain the rules definitions. `hl_atoms.json` defines the high-level structures dimensions.
